# Instructions: 

Before initially running this script, input your Exhange server address in the $server variable on line 17. This will allow the script to run faster than 
inputting the server each time. Future versions may instead include a config file for this information. The script is also setup to not prompt for additional
credentials, so be sure to run the program with credentials that have administrative priveleges on the serer.
